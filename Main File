CEO of Mcookie
Kazarichuk Konstantin
As a child, I remember my mother working long hours at a fashion clothing store to provide for our family since I grew up without a father.
She didn't have much time to focus on my education and provide me with a proper motivation plan. I know that’s hard. I know that many parents today face similar challenges, and that's why I came up with the idea to develop an app that can help.
With this app, I want to make it easier for parents to provide their children with the opportunity to learn and grow, even with busy schedules.
By doing so, I hope to make a positive impact on families around the world and help kids reach their full potential.
